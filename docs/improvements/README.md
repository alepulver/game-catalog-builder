# Improvement proposals

This folder contains design notes for potential future refactors and features. These documents are intentionally exploratory (pros/cons, tradeoffs, and alternatives) so we can revisit them later.

- `output-field-configuration.md`: approaches for configuring which provider fields land in final outputs.
- `provider-enhancements.md`: proposal for adding higher-value provider fields and improving validation signals without adding much column clutter.
