# DOOM (2016) provider captures

These files were generated by:

```bash
python -m game_catalog_builder.tools.fetch_provider_examples "Doom (2016)"
```

Quick pointers:
- RAWG uses a numeric game id (see `rawg.best.json`) and a separate `rawg.detail.json` document.
- Steam uses an appid (see `steam.best.json` → `steam.appdetails.json`), and SteamSpy uses the same appid.
- IGDB uses a numeric id (see `igdb.best.json`) and includes `first_release_date` to disambiguate 1993 vs 2016. See `igdb.games.expanded_single.json` for the single-call expanded fields shape used by the enrichment client.

Selected identifiers (for joining the same row):
- RAWG: id `2454` (released 2016)
- Steam/SteamSpy: appid `379720` (released 2016)
- IGDB: id `7351` (released 2016)
- HLTB: `Doom` (released 2016)

If present, IGDB’s `external_games` Steam uid can be stored as a cross-check against the Steam-selected appid.
