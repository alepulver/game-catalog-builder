# Optional mapping for `Production_Tier` classification.
#
# Copy to `data/production_tiers.yaml` and edit as desired.
# That file is intentionally git-ignored.
#
# Supported tiers are free-form strings, but recommended values are:
#   - AAA
#   - AA
#   - Indie
#
# Matching is exact against extracted provider strings (currently Steam dev/pub):
#   - `Steam_Publishers` (comma-separated)
#   - `Steam_Developers` (comma-separated)
#
# Example:
# publishers:
#   "Bethesda Softworks": "AAA"
# developers:
#   "id Software": "AAA"

publishers: {}
developers: {}
