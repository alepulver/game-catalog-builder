- Make user data (input) and output columns configurable; for the latter, keep a schema or flat list of available data per provider with description (so they can be mapped to the output)
- Keep working on derived metrics with ChatGPT (tags, estimated popularity, users, production level, replayability, mods, "must play classic", etc)
- Support for checking mod websites such as nexus to determine activity, number of mods, etc
- Check if there is a remake or new edition?
