- Keep working on derived metrics with ChatGPT (tags, estimated popularity, users, production level, replayability, mods, "must play classic", etc)
- Support for checking mod websites such as nexus to determine activity, number of mods, etc
- Create backend: task queues with dependencies, incremental updates and DB storage (full sqlite, remove JSONL outputs by default and keep as state dump). More providers should run in parallel
- Create frontend: look for other UIs for inspiration, add overlays and autoplay videos from gameplays, sorting, filtering, allow editing the import and enrich outputs (implement workflow, should post back to backend)
- Can use API keys for Steam, OpenCritic, Nexus Mods and scraping for ModDB. Python packages available
