- Run providers in parallel (keeping individual limits)
- Remove year from user collections as they don't show up in IGDB
- Add a doc reference with examples (and perhaps configuration) of data available from different providers in JSON
- Make limit adjustments part of credentials.yaml and rename to general configuration file
- Separate the process of obtaining and confirming provider IDs for each game, from data fetching process (store the ID only next to user data, then join)
- Make user data (input) and output columns configurable
- Keep working on derived metrics with ChatGPT (tags, estimated popularity, users, production level, replayability, mods, "must play classic", etc)
- Use local directory or home dot directory for cache and partial information, not hardcoded
