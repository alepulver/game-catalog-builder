- Keep working on derived metrics with ChatGPT (tags, estimated popularity, users, production level, replayability, mods, "must play classic", etc)
- Support for checking mod websites such as nexus to determine activity, number of mods, etc
- Refactor to create frontend and backend. Implement data queue with dependencies, incremental updates and DB storage (full sqlite, in addition to configurable json and csv exports)
- Can use API keys for Steam, OpenCritic, Nexus Mods and scraping for ModDB. Python packages available
- Internal format and output configuration
  - Make user data (input) and output columns configurable; for the latter, keep a schema or flat list of available data per provider with description (so they can be mapped to the output)
  - Make output fields hierarchical (defined with paths from providers and types, so they can generate a JSON or CSV)
